# NIZL - Mozambican Car Rental Company
Welcome to the NIZL website! This project showcases a fictional car rental company based in Mozambique. I built this site in 2022 as part of my journey to perfect my HTML and CSS skills, experimenting with new designs and layouts. While it may not represent my current best work, it is a solid example of my abilities at the time.
